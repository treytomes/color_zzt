# color_zzt
An attempted reproduction of the Town of ZZT for the Color Computer 3.

## EXEC.BAT

I'm using this batch file to assembly and run programs using the Vcc emulator.  You'll need to set the variables at the top of this file to point to your own copies of lwasm and vcc.

The batch file takes 1 parameter:  The name of the file to be assembled, minus the extension.
